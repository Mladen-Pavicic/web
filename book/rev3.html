I would just like to offer an explanation to the reader of  
<a href="http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/ioport/en/?q=an%3A05014307">this Review</a>.

<br><br>
The reviewer writes: "An example of unprecise use of language is the misleading title of section 1.20. Teleportation does not send a copy of the state but only carries over the state from one atom to another." 

<br><br>
The provocative title of Sec. 1.20 ("Teleportation of Copies and the No-Cloning Theorem")  
is explained in the section (p. 58, bottom) as follows: "We cannot clone unknown qubits, 
but we can nevertheless copy them. We just have to pay a price for doing so: 
the original must be destroyed in the process."   

<br><br>
I hate to comment on a review and I would not do that for obvious but irrelevant 
misunderstanding (as e.g., about CMOS) but the one about the "copy" is 
too grave to be left uncommented. For, if I had really claimed that one 
could make a copy of an arbitrary quantum state and keep the original state, that 
would have most likely make the reader brush aside the book.
