Recently, a close connection was established between nonlocality, 
Bell experiments,  quantum communication, and quantum cryptography, 
on the one side, and quantum logic gates, quantum computing, 
and quantum logic, on the other. [C.H. Bennett et al., Phys. 
Rev. Lett. 76, 722 (1996)] All of them, Bell experiments, 
quantum communication/cryptographic schemes, and quantum computers 
use entangled systems as their inputs and the detection efficienciencies 
of the latter were so far very low (under 10
experiments carried out so far relied only on (nanoseconds) 
coincidental detections and that made them inconclusive in 
principle. [E. Santos, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 1388 (1995); Phys. 
Lett. A 212, 10 (1996)]. Recently we discovered a new kind 
of entanglement [M. Pavicic and J. Summhammer, Phys. Rev. 
Lett. 73,  3191 (1994)] and a new preselective scheme of entangling 
independent systems [M. Pavicic, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 12, 821 
(1995)] which should enable over 70
main hypothesis of the proposed project is that preselection 
of entangled photon pairs can be used for designing quantum 
logic gates for quantum computers, for obtaining user-ready 
input pairs in quantum cryptography and quantum communication, 
as well as for a long-wanted loophole-free Bell experiment, 
on the one hand, and that the algebraic representation of 
quantum logic (new desarguesian orthomodular lattices) can 
provide necessary algorithms for quantum computers, on the 
other. The aim of the project is to carry out all the elements 
from the hypothesis. Our basic methods will be our theory 
of the spin-correlated interferometry. [M. Pavicic, Physical 
Review A, 50, 3486 (1994)] and our new representation of quantum 
 logic [M. Pavicic, Int. J. Theor. Phys. 32, 1481 (1993)]. 
First feasible loophole-free Bell experiment and a feasible 
interaction-free experiment with over 95
so far) are expected as first testable results. An objective 
indicator of the importance and influence of a branch is the 
number of papers in the leading journals, e.g., Phys. Rev. 
Lett., Phys. Rev. A, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B, and App. Phys. B. 
Only Phys. Rev. Lett. with the highest impact factor, 7.2 
of all physical journals published more than 20 papers in 
the branches of quantum computers, cryptography, and communication 
(Bell experiments, quantum interferometry, etc.). On the other 
hand, we published in all the above journals recently. Therefore, 
the proposal may be ranked as important.

Recent foundational investigations and experiments 
in quantum mechanics and quantum optics significantly contributed 
to quantum communication and computation technology. The advances 
were mostlyrelated to the intensity interference and were 
stimulated by a tremendous increase in the detection technique. 
It is therefore essential to develop models of quantum entanglement 
and quantum nonlocality which underly quantum communication 
and computation and this is our main objective. In doing so, 
we use the standard quantum optical methods as well as new 
algebraico-probabilistic ones.

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
Lately, important developments 
have been made in the field of quantum logic, quantum gates, 
and preparation of entangled states. This has sharply increased 
the interest in a possible physical realization of quantum 
computers, quantum communication, and quantum cryptography. 
The goal of this project is to develop a method for preparing 
preselected entangled  states and  to develop logical structures 
underlying quantum mechanical computation. Preselected entangled 
states will enable realizable quantum gates and quantum cryptographic 
pairs and quantum structures will provide quantum algorithms.

<P>

<B>Priority Estimate</B></DIV>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
The proposed project is compatible with the priority <I>Information 
and Communication Technologies </I>in the following way. Preselected 
entangled photon states may be used as input states for quantum 
computers and cryptographic communication. Devices for their 
preparation can be used as quantum gates for quantum computers. 
Quantum structures (quantum logic, orthomodular lattices, 
desarguesian lattices, probabilistic representations of these 
lattices, etc.) can be used as algorithms for quantum computers. 
Quantum computers are a kind of information technology under 
development and cryptographic communication is a kind of communication 
technology under development. Classical computer technology 
is coming to its limits: quantum tunneling between neighbouring 
circuts will soon limit further shrinking and this, together 
with the relativistic upper signal velocity, will also soon 
limit further increase in the speed. Quantum computers, however, 
can significantly increase these limits by the way they work; 
e.g., they do not calculate inteference, they perform interference. 
It is therefore essential to start designing quantum computers 
as the next generation of the computer technology. As for 
the quantum cryptography, it is absolutely superior to the 
classical cryptography because eavesdroping a quantum encrypted 
message is impossible in principle. Putting together quantum 
computers and quantum cryptography this reads: hacking of 
a quantum computer network is impossible in principle.

<B>Possible Applications</B></DIV>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
First of all, the results of the research can be applied in further 
theoretical development of quantum intensity interfereometry, 
quantum logic, orthomodular lattice theory, and the theory 
of quantum computers and of quantum cryptography. Then, calculated 
preparation of preselected entangled photon state can be used 
for designing a loophole-free Bell experiment which is the 
simplest version of a quantum computer and which can be carried 
out by means of the existing detection technology. That would 
be a first conclusive Bell-Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment 
carried out without supplementary assumptions (i.e., a ``loophole-free''
one) in the World so far. The preselection scheme which will 
be used, includes the concept of a gate so that one will be 
able to apply the set-up for a realization of quantum gates. 
We emphasize that such four photon entanglement and preselection 
scheme are our discoveries which have not been previously 
reported in the literature.The Bell pairs obtained by the 
preselection scheme can be used as user-ready pairs in quantum 
cryptography which has got a unique property to be unbreakable 
in principle: eavesdroping of a message destroys the message. 
Preselected single photons appear in our scheme unpolarized 
and therefore the scheme can be used as a source of precisely 
directed unpolarized single photons which is not possible 
with previous sources: e.g., photons emitted from an atom 
in a cascade process are emitted in all possible directions.

<P>
In the background of the proposed project recent developments 
of the following four fields are interwoven: 

<P>
(1) quantum computer theory; 

<P>
(2) quantum cryptography and nonlocality; 

<P>
(3) quantum intensity interferometry; 

<P>
(4) quantum logic. 

<P>
(1) In 1995 several important results were achieved:  

<P>
a) it was proved that the von Neumann quantum entropy  is equal to 
the number of qubits (spin-1/2 subsystems, quantum bits) within the 
density matrix [B. Schumacher,  Quantum coding, Phys. Rev. A 51, 
2738 (1995)]; 

<P>
b) it was shown that quantum gates operating on just 
two bits are sufficient for constructing quantum computer circuits 
[A. Berenco et al., Conditional quantum dynamics and logic 
gates, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 4083 (1995)]; 

<P>
c) it was shown 
that quantum computer does prime factoring in polynomial time 
(classical computer takes exponential time) [A. Ekert et al., 
Shor's quantum algorithm for factorizing numbers, preprint, 
Math. Dept., Plymouth Univ., UK (1995)]. 

<P>
It is therefore essential 
to design physically realizable quantum gates. The first two 
have already been proposed: one with CQED (cavity quantum 
electrodynamics) technique [T. Sleator et al., Realizable 
universal quantum gates, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 4087 (1995)] 
and the other with cold ions [J.I. Cirac et al., Quantum 
computations with cold trapped ions, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 
4091 (1995)].  

<P>
(2) Quantum cryptography, quantum nonlocality, 
and the Bell experiments are closely related since all of 
them are based on entangled states. Both Bell experiments 
and cryptographic shemes relied on coincidental counts within 
nanoseconds. For a practical realization of a cryptographic 
communication this is a serious problem and for Bell experiments 
this turned out to be an additional assumption which made 
all experiments carried out so far inconclusive. [E. Santos, 
Does quantum mechanics violate the Bell inequalities? Phys. 
Rev. Lett. 66, 1388 (1995)]. The reason for that were postselection 
and detection loopholes [E. Santos, Unreliability of performed 
tests of Bell’s inequality using parametric down-converted 
photons, Phys. Lett. A 212, 10 (1996)]. So, a number of loophole-free 
experiments have been proposed recently [R.T. Jones et al., 
Quantum mechanics and Bell’s inequalities, Phys. Rev. Lett. 
72, 267 (1994); M. Pavicic, Spin-correlated interferometry 
with beam splitters: preselection of spin-correlated photons, 
 J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 12, 821 (1995)]. On the other hand, quantum 
cryptography conjectured that it should be possible to entangle 
independent already entangled pairs of systems [C.H. Bennett, 
Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and 
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1895 
(1993)]. We proved the conjecture for the spin space [M. Pavicic 
and J. Summhammer,  Interferometry with Two Pairs of Spin 
Correlated Photons, Phys. Rev. Lett. 73,  3191 (1994)]. A 
direct consequence of this result was that quantum nonlocality 
is a property of selection and not of an entanglement at a 
common origin [M. Pavicic, Preselection with certainty of 
photons in a singlet state from a set of independent photons, 
Int. J. Theor. Phys. 34, 1653 (1995)]. Taken together, switching 
from postselection to preselection experiments can solve both 
problems. 

<P>
(3) Quantum intensity interference (interference 
of the fourth order) is the main tool of the most considered 
experiments. In the past ten years a number of novel effects 
which differ essentially from the usual amplitude interference 
(of the second order) have been discovered. For our project 
the essential effect is that the interference makes unpolarized 
independent photons entangled in polarization [M. Pavicic, 
Spin correlated interferometry for polarized and unpolarized 
photons on a beam splitter, Phys. Rev.A 50,  3486 (1994)]. 

<P>
(4) Quantum logic became a wast branch of both physics and 
mathematics.[M. Pavicic, Bibliography on  quantum logics 
and related structures, Int. J. Theor. Phys. 31, 373 (1995)].

I was the principal investigator of the former project 
<I>Algebraico-Probabilistic 
Structures of Quantum  Mechanics </I>(1-03-176). We will use 
the following two of its results: 

<P>
(1) Starting from two independent 
entangled photon pairs, one can preselect two photons from 
different pairs into the singlet state by an interference 
performed by the other two photons from these different pairs; 

<P>
(2) The unique bi-implication was proved to characterize  
quantum logic and its YES-NO representation of quantum logic. 

<P>
(1) will be used for quantum gates and quantum cryptography, 

<P>
(2) for quantum algorithms.

An indicator of the importance and meaning of a particular 
branch is the number of papers published in the leading journals 
of the field, e.g., Phys.Rev.Lett., Phys.Rev.A, J.Opt.Soc.Am.B, 
and App.Phys.B. Only Phys. Rev. Lett. with the highest impact 
factor, 7.2 of all physical journals published in 1995 more 
than 20 papers in the branches of quantum computers, quantum 
cryptography, and quantum communication (Bell experiments, 
quantum intensity interference, etc.) as opposed to &lt;10 in 
1993. On the other hand, I published papers in all these journals. 
Thus, the project can be ranked as important.

Main aims

<P>
(1) to design and calculate in all 
realistic details a loophole-free Bell experiment using downconversion 
in two type-II nonlinear crystals fed by a subpicosecond laser; 
the set up will preselect independent photons into (non)maximally 
entangled pairs on an asymmetrical beam splitter; 

<P>
(2) to implement preselected entangled photon pairs scheme as user-ready 
inputs for quantum communication and cryptography; 

<P>
(3) to investigate whether a preselection scheme can be carried out 
with monolithic total internal reflection resonators with 
quantum tunneling for inputs and outputs and whether one can 
use such resonators as quantum gates in quantum computer circuits;
 
(4) to obtain new algebraic varietes of desarguesian orthomodular

<P>
Referring to the points 
from the previous section the methods will be as follows: 

<P>
(1) to describe downconversion we shall use its theory as 
elaborated in L. Mandel and E. Wolf, Optical Coherence and 
Quantum Optics, Cambridge University Press (1995); to describe 
the interference of the fourth order at an asymmetrical beam 
splitter we shall use its theory as introduced and elaborated 
in M. Pavicic, Spin Correlated Interferometry for  Polarized 
and Unpolarized Photons on a Beam Splitter,  Physical Review 
A, 50, 3486-3491 (1994); 

<P>
(2) to describe spatial distribution 
of photons downconverted in type-II nonlinear crystals we 
shall use the elaboration from A. Joobeur, B.E.A. Saleh, and 
M.C. Teich, Physical Review  A 50, 3349-3361 (1994); 

<P>
(3) to describe MOTIRR (monolithic total-internal-reflection resonator) 
and FTIR (frustrated total internal reflection, i.e., optical 
tunneling) we shall use its theory as elaborated in S. Schiller 
and R.I. Byer, Quadruply Resonant Optical Parametric Oscillation 
in a Monolithic Total-Internal-Reflection Resonator, Journal 
of the Optical Society of America B, 10, 1696-1707 (1993); 
to describe quantum gates we might use some ideas from D.P. 
Di Vincenzo, Two-Bit Gates Are Universal for Quantum Computation, 
Physical Review A 51, 1015-1022 (1995); 

<P>
(3) to obtain new algebraic varietes of quantum logic 
and orthomodular lattices 
we shall use standard quantum logic, i.e., lattice theory 
methods as elaborated in P. Ptak and Pulmannova, Orthomodular 
Structures as Quantum Logics, Kluwer, Dordrecht, Holland 
(1991) as well as our new representation of quantum  logic 
as introduced and elaborated in  M. Pavicic, Non-Ordered 
Quantum Logic and Its Yes-No Representation, International 
Journal of Theoretical Physics, 32, 1481-1505 (1993).

<P><P>

<P>
First, 
the elaboration of the preselection set-up will be made. Spatio-temporal 
distribution of photons downconverted from type-II crystals 
will be calculated by means of wave packet and the lowered 
visibility of the intensity interference by means of integration 
over the dimensions of the pinholes in front of the detectors. 
Thereupon, various experimental parameters will be introduced 
and evaluated. This elaboration will enable us to complete 
points (1) and (2) from the last but one section. As 
for point (3) of Sec. <I>Methods </I>we shall first calculate resonance 
with monolithic total internal reflection resonators with 
quantum tunneling for inputs and outputs for pulse lasers 
using Gaussian wave packets and then for cw (continuous wave) 
lasers in order to determine the main properties of such resonators 
and whether one can use such resonators as quantum gates in 
quantum computer circuits; In the end, we shall try to obtain 
new algebraic varietes of desarguesian orthomodular lattices, 
i.e., new representations of quantum logic and corresopnding 
algorithms for quantum computing.
