It is shown that orthomodular lattice is an ortholattice 
in which a <i> unique </i> operation of bi-implication  
corresponds to equality relation and that the ordering relation 
in the binary formulation of quantum logic as well as the 
operation of implication (conditional) in quantum logic are 
completely irrelevant for their axiomatization. The soundness and
completeness theorems for the corresponding algebraic unified quantum 
logic are proved. A proper semantics, i.e., a representation 
of quantum logic is given by means of a new YES-NO relation 
which enables a proof of the finite model property and decidability
of quantum logic. A statistical YES-NO physical interpretation of 
the quantum logical propositions is provided.
