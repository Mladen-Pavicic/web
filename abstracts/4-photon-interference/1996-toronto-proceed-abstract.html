Two previously discovered effects in the intensity interference: a
spin--correlation between formerly unpolarized photons and a spin 
entanglement <I> at-a-distance  </I> between photons that nowhere 
interacted, have been used for a proposal of a new  <I> preselection 
experiment </I>. The experiment puts together two photons from 
two independent singlets and makes them interfere at an 
asymmetrical beam splitter. A coincidental detection of two 
photons emerging from different sides of the beam splitter 
<I> preselect </I> their pair-companion photons (which nowhere 
cross each other's path) into a nonmaximal singlet state. 
The quantum mechanical nonlocality thus proves to be essentially 
a property of selection.  This enables a loophole-free experimental 
disproof of local hidden-variable theories requiring detection 
efficiency as low as 67% and an exclusion of all nonlocal 
hidden-variable theories that rely on some kind of a physical 
entanglement by means of a common medium.
