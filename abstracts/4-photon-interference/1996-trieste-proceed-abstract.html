We present several kinds of experiments which prepare
entanglements between photons that nowhere interacted
and whose paths nowhere crossed. The experiments put
together two or more photons from two or more (non-maximal)
singlet-like or triplet-like photon pairs and make them
interfere in the intensity at an asymmetrical beam splitter.
As a result one finds polarization correlations between the other
companion photons from the pairs whose paths nowhere
crossed each other even when no polarization measurements have been
carried out on the former photons upon emergence from the beam splitter.
It turns out that the latter set of photons that nowhere
interacted contains subsets of photons in the (non-maximal) singlet
state and since we are able to extract such photons with probability
one, we can consider them event-ready prepared in an entangled state
by their pair-companion photons that interfered at the beam splitter.
The preparation of photon pairs by beam splitters fed from
nonlinear crystals as well as by single non-linear crystals
of type-II are considered in realistic experimental conditions.
Such setups can be used for closing all the remaining loopholes
in the Bell theorem with detection efficiency as low as 67\%.
One can do this with or without use of the Bell inequalities
depending on the chosen orientations of the polarizers used in the
experiments. The result reveals nonlocality as a property of
selection which can even be a preselection. It also reveals that one
can predict spin-correlated behaviour of photons in space and at
beam splitters by controlling other than spin observables. On the
other hand, the setup can be used for preparing non-maximal
entangled states without losing counts as opposed to the attenuation
method. [Abstract as appeared in the Book of Abstracts at the
