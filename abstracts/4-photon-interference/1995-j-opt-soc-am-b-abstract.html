<FONT SIZE="+1"><b><I>Abstract. </I></B>A nonclassical 
feature of the fourth order interference at a beam 
splitter, that genuine photon spin singlets are emitted in predetermined 
directions even when incident photons are unpolarized, has been used 
in a proposal for an experiment that imposes quantum spin correlation 
on truly independent photons. In the experiment two photons from two 
such singlets interfere at a beam splitter, and as a result the other 
two photons - which nowhere interacted and whose paths nowhere 
crossed - exhibit a 100% correlation in polarization, even when 
no polarization has been measured in the first two photons. The 
propsed experiment permits closure of the remaining loopholes in the 
Bell theorem proof, reveals the quantum nonlocality as a property of 
selection, and pioneers an experimental procedure for exact preparation
of unequal superposition.
