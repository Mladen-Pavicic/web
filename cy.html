<p><font face="Arial">This factsheet gives an overview of successful strategies used in
European cities to promote the use of the bicycle as a means of transport.</font></font><font SIZE="5"><b></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">European examples of good practice</font></b></font><font SIZE="2"></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">All over Europe there are cities where politicians have recognised
the potential of the bicycle to solve traffic related problems like congestion and
air-pollution. However, there is no such thing as a single model city for bicycle traffic.
Several examples were selected to show how bicycle promotion can work under different
conditions.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Troisdorf (Germany; 65,000 inhabitants)</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Troisodrf is remarkable not just for its innovative measurers for
Bicycle traffic, But also for its public relations efforts and for financing about 70% of
its bicycle infrastructure by subsidies from the federal and regional governments.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Salzburg (Austria; 145,000 inhabitants)</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In Salzburg many Bicycle facilities were created but bicycle traffic
really soared after the introduction of a new parking policy.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Groningen (Netherlands: 165,000 inhabitants)</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Groningen capital of the Dutch province of Groningen is almost
&quot;legendary&quot; for its proportion of bicycle traffic which amounts to approximately
50% of all trips. This success is mainly due to restrictions for car traffic in the city
centre as well as traffic-reducing land-use planning.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Geneva (Switzerland; 170,000 inhabitants)</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Geneva is among the cities with the highest degree of motorization
Despite this situation, the city became one of the best places to learn about competent
planning for bicycle traffic in the latin part of Europe.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Basel (Switzerland; 170,000 inhabitants)</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Keeping the whole network of streets open and usable for cyclists is
more important than just building a few cycle-ways. In Basel, most one-way streets are
open far two-way bicycle traffic, speed humps have flat passages far cyclists; at big
intersections cyclists can use extra lanes for turning to the left and many bus lanes are
open for cyclists.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Other Examples:</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">York and Houten - mentioned in the T&amp;E-factsheet 'walking in
cities' - also are positive examples for the promotion of Bicycle traffic. Further
examples are the German towns of Munster and Erlangen. Darmstadt in Germany is well known
for legalising cycling in its large pedestrian zone Saarbruucken (Germany) was a 'hopeless
case' for cyclists until the city decided to open all one-way streets in 30 km/h-zones for
two-way bicycle traffic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Copenhagen (Denmark) is the place where the traditional instrument
of bicycle-promotion - the cycle way - has been brought to perfection. Nakskov (Denmark)
with 16,000 inhabitants is an example of a very small town that promoted bicycle traffic
successfully. Winterthur</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">(Switzerland) has on extensive network of cycle routes and is
regarded as the most bicycle-friendly city in Switzerland.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">By the standards of other European countries, many towns in the
Netherlands like Delft, Appeldoorn, Leiden or Tilburg - just to mention a few - are model
bicycle cities.</font></font><font SIZE="5"><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Conclusions - lessons learned</font></p>
</b></font><font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><i><b><font SIZE="4" face="Arial">Promotion
of the bicycle can only be part of a successful traffic policy</font><font SIZE="4"></p>
</font></b></i><font SIZE="2">

<p><font face="Arial">In many European cities, car traffic still enjoys privileges that
make it a perfectly sensible idea to use the car even in city centres. Only after Salzburg
abolished free parking in the central districts bicycle use in this area increased by 120%
within weeks. Groningen would not have had the slightest chance to reach its high level of
bicycle use had it not reserved a fair proportion of road space formerly occupied by cars
for public transport and non-motorised road users. Much more than the present 21% of
employees living in Basel would go to work by car if the number of company parking lots
had not been severely limited in recent years.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">No bicycle promotion without public relations</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The decision to use a bicycle largely depends on opinions and
attitudes. Changing attitudes towards cycling can bring as big a change in bicycle use as
the construction of bicycle facilities. Traffic policy for the bicycle is only successful
if it can be sold to the electorate. Both aims - changing attitudes towards cycling and
selling good achievements to the electorate - require consequent public relations as part
of every program for bicycle promotion.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Think about aims before thinking about solutions</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is not the aim to build as many cycle paths as possible, but to
make the bicycle more attractive as a means of transport. If people are asked why they
chose a certain means of transport, &quot;saving time&quot; is always mentioned as the
most important reason. Safety only comes in second place, and convenience comes third.
This means that cycling must be made safer, but also faster (=without delays and detours)
and more comfortable.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">How to make cycling faster</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The most important task is not just to increase the speed of
cycling, but to avoid unnecessary loss of time. Cyclists loose time, for instance, by
detours or if they have a shorter green phase at traffic lights. By far the biggest
obstacle to cycling are the many regulations for motorised traffic which were never meant
for cyclists but cost them a lot of time, one-way streets, no left (right) turn permitted
or pedestrian zone (in some cases). The ideal target would be to give cyclists back the
freedom of movement they enjoyed before all those special regulations for motorised
traffic were introduced.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">How to make cycling safer</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At crossings, using a cycle path can be more dangerous than cycling
on the roadway. In most cases accidents are caused by conflicts between cars turning and
cyclists going straight on. Only by making conflicts visible and calculable for car
drivers accidents can be avoided. Besides efforts to reduce accident risk at crossings,
the most important important measure for the safety of cyclists is speed reduction of
motorised traffic.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">How to make cycling more comfortable</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As mentioned above, cycle ways have very little to do with safety
but they have a lot to do with comfort. It makes cyclists feel comfortable to be separated
from motorized traffic. Cycle paths should be wide enough, clearly separated from the
pavement and they should have smooth asphalt paving . As bicycles do not have suspension,
kerbstones, stone paving and the like should not be put in the way of cyclists.</font></p>

<p></font><font SIZE="5"><b><font face="Arial">Major errors to be avoided:</font></p>
</b></font><font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><i><b><font SIZE="4" face="Arial">A
pavement is not a cycle way</font><font SIZE="4"></p>
</font></b></i><font SIZE="2">

<p><font face="Arial">Shared pavements for cyclists and pedestrians or 'cycle ways' built
on pavement-level or just painted on pavements are an invention of car-orientated traffic
planning of recent decades. Cycling on pedestrian pavements is dangerous in any case
(legalised or not). Space for cyclists should always be taken from the roadway and not
from the pavement.</font></font><font SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A cyclist is not a pedestrian on wheels</font></b></i></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Both walking and cycling seem to Be &quot;Slow&quot; compared with
motorized traffic. It is easily forgotten that the average cyclist moves five times as
fast as the average pedestrian. Therefore competent traffic engineering for bicycle
traffic has very little in common with traffic engineering for pedestrians</font></p>
