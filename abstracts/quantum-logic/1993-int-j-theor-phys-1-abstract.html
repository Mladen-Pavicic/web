It is shown that orthomodular lattice can be axiomatized 
as an ortholattice with a <i> unique </i> operation of identity 
(bi-implication) instead of the operation of implication and a 
corresponding algebraic unified quantum  logic is formulated. 
A statistical YES-NO physical interpretation of the quantum logical 
propositions is then provided to establish a support for a novel 
YES-NO representation of quantum logic which is also given together 
with a conjecture about possible completion of quantum 
logic by means of probabilistic forcing.
