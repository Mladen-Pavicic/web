Pavicic, Quantum Computation: Parallelism and Visualization 
 (1184) </font></b></i> on the part of the Scientific Board
and <b><font color=green> a proposal for a separated treatment

<br><br>
Dear Sir/Madam, 

<br><br>
On January 15, 2007 the State Secretary for Science and 
Technology Professor Drazen Vikic Topic sent us the reports of 
the referees and of the <i>Scientific Board</i> on our 
project <blockquote><b><i><font color=green>Quantum Computation: 
Parallelism and Visualization (1184)</font></i>  
</b></blockquote>
and advised us to submit a revised version of the project, taking 
into account the opinions of the referees and the <i>Scientific 
Board</i>.

<br><br>
We accepted the advice and submitted a revised version of 
our project under the number 3380. In this version we have taken 
into account all the objections and suggestions of the referees
and/or clarified all the points that were insufficiently explained 
or unclear. By doing so we have also taken into account points 
I, II, V, and VI of the report of the <i>Scientific 
Board</i> in which points they completely embrace the opinions 
of the referees. 


<br><br>  
In points V and VI (<b><font color=green>competence of the head 
of the project and competence of his co-workers</font></b>, respectively) 
the <i>Scientific Board</i>
<b><font color=#DD0000>"corrected"</font></b> the average referees' 
scores 
<a href="http://zprojekti.mzos.hr/upute/Upute_R&PS-opce_EN.pdf" 
target="_blank">
<b>4,83=scientific achievement on world level</b></a> 
(for the head) and 
<a href="http://zprojekti.mzos.hr/upute/Upute_R&PS-opce_EN.pdf" 
target="_blank">
<b>3,30= significant scientific achievement on national level
</b></a> (for the co-workers) by 
<b><font color=blue>"a factor of scientific production and impact"</font></b> 
to <a href="http://zprojekti.mzos.hr/upute/Upute_R&PS-opce_EN.pdf" 
target="_blank"> 
<b><font color=#DD0000>2=below basic scientific standards</font></b></a>, 
<b><font color=#DD0000> rejected </font></b> the proposals of  
<b><font color=green>both referees to accept the project</font></b>, and  
<b><font color=#DD0000> rejected </font></b> the project proposal. 
The <i>Scientific 
Board</i> advises us to "focus ourselves to our work on other projects 
to which we applied as coworkers" although there is no overlapping 
of these projects with ours.

<br><br>
The importance of  
quantum computer research can be estimated by about 
<b><font color=green> 50000000 </font></b> 
pages  which <i> Google </i> provides you with when you type 
<i> quantum computer</i> in as well as billions of dollars 
invested in their research annually. And as the enclosed analysis 
reveals it is in the interest of  the World and Croatian science to 
keep this research alive. 
In particular because it is the  <b><font color=green>only research 
in Croatia engaged in the theory of quantum computers</font></b>. 

<br><br> 
The <i>Scientific Board</i> did not clarify what 
"scientific production and impact" might be but we have  
assumed, on the basis of e-mails of two members of the 
<i>Scientific Board</i>, that they mean a number 
of <i> Current Contents </i> papers, their <i> Impact 
Factor</i>, and their <i>Citations without self-citations</i> 
per co-author, in accordance with international bibliometric 
standards. Although we think that it is absolutely 
unacceptable that, in creation of a scientific policy of a 
country, administrative factors be substituted for  
opinions of competent specialists, we have nevertheless 
<b><font color=green>counted those factors for our group 
and for the heads of all 72 projects whose funding has 
been approved by this <i>Ministry</i> following the 
proposals of the <i>Scientific Board</i> and compared them.  
</font></b>

<br><br> 
What we have obtained (for the previous-project period, 
2002-2006) is that our head is - according to the number of  
<i> Current Contents </i> papers, their <i> Impact Factors</i>, 
and their <i>citations</i> - <b><font color=green> better 
than 41, 29, and 26 heads of 72 accepted projects</font></b>, 
respectively and that our coworkers are 
<b><font color=green> better than 49, 18, and 51 heads of 72 
accepted projects</font></b>, respectively. 
From the details given in the enclosed web pages 
(whose links are given below) it also emerges that ascribing 
our factors to the  heads of 72 accepted projects thoroughly
mix up the rank list provided by the Ministry.  
 
<br><br> 
<b><font color=blue>
Hence, it is not only 
<blockquote>
that the <i>Scientific Board</i> rejected the positive 
evaluation of the referees and their advice to accept the 
project as well as numerous available evidences of the high 
scientific quality of the work done by the the head of the 
project and his coworkers, 
<br><br>
and that the <i>Scientific Board</i> still has not revealed its 
criteria and that it acted out of accord with the physics community
and at odds with the proclaimed policy of the Ministry 
to leave the evaluation of project proposals to the 
referees
</blockquote>
but also - as our analysis and comparison of all 72 accepted projects
with our project (s. links 4-6) show - that </font></b>
<blockquote>
<b><font color=#DD0000> the <i>Scientific Board</i>
has not treated our and other projects equally </font></b>
</blockquote>
<b><font color=blue>
and this should worry the scientific community, this Ministry,
and the public. </font></b>

<br><br> 
Because of all this and being guided by the detailed 
analysis available at the address (in English and 
Croatian)
<blockquote>
<a href="/pavicic/projekt/recenzija/index-en.html" target="_blank">
http://m3k.grad.hr/pavicic/projekt/recenzija/index-en.html</a>
</blockquote>
we propose to the Ministry:

<br>

<blockquote>
<b><font color=green>
1. to send the revised version (3380) of our project to 
the those referees who already reviewed the original 
version of the project (1184);

<br><br>
2.<b><font color=#DD0000> <i> not to accept </font></i></b>
a rejection of referees' evaluations on the part of the 
<i>Scientific Board</i>;

<br><br>
3. to rank our project between 72 previously accepted ones in 
order to compensate the hardships inflicted on our project 
by the <i>Scientific Board</i> through their inappropriate 
rejection of referees' evaluations;

<br><br>
4. to approve a five-year span for the project (as given 
to all previous projects under programs) and to approve 
integrating the project with the other projects under the 
program <i>Distributed Processing and Scientific Data 
Visualization</i> headed by Karolj Skala; this is how we 
originally submitted the project;

<br><br>
5. to allow us (upon receiving referees' evaluations) to 
submit a request for equipment needed for the project after
the deadline taking into account that the <i>Scientific 
Board</i> through their inappropriate rejection of referees' 
evaluations prevented us from doing so in time;  

<br><br>
6. to already now at the beginning of the new project period 
has the way of and criteria for the evaluation of the 
projects defined as well set up the criteria for approving 
new ones afterwards.
</font></b>
