 </td>
 <td width="75%" align=left>Scientific objective of the proposed 
ambitious and modern research proposal is based on the former 
recognized work carried out by its head. In particular this applies
to his description of quantum systems by discrete finite dimensional
Hilbert spaces, elaboration of Fourier algorithms for atom 
states and application of quantum algebras and quantum equations. 
His design of algorithms for exhaustive generation of codes for 
quantum error correction is particularly significant. The assumptions, 
purpose, and goals of the research overlap, are repeated, and are 
given too generalized definitions so that is difficult to determine 
a possible influence of this research on a development of other 
fields. Applications of the research and its fitting into 
strategic goals are presented in a too generalized way.

 <td width="15%" align=center>2nd report
 </td>
 <td width="75%" align=left>This is a very ambitious multidisciplinary
project engaged into a number of open questions in the field of 
quantum information. Its head has already carried out a number 
of very successful projects and many works in the field. 
<br><br>9.1. The main hypothesis is scientifically sound (5) 
and the field is very vibrant, interesting, important 
for fundamental research (quantum physics), and a great 
potential application (computational methods, cryptography). 
In this field, the distance between basic results and possible 
application is incredibly short. The project explores what 
is explored by other similar projects in the World but by 
means of pretty original own - now partly published - theoretical 
methods (4.5). Altogether for 9.1 the score is (on average) 4.8.
<br><br>
9.2 Contribution, impact, and research priority alignment are 
excellent (4.6).
<br><br>
9.3 Application of the proposed research is mostly in further research, 
and applications in other fields are limited to a future development of
quantum computers. In this sense, the project is not self-contained 
and does not build up a self-contained research with other projects in 
Croatia. We do not take it amiss since it investigates but a small 
segment (picked up according to the current available budget and 
suitability of publishing as many papers as possible) on a road from 
posing a problem to solving it - a syndrome of the Croatian 
scientific research scene. Therefore, for this part: for a contribution 
to possible applications (possibly and regrettably outside of Croatia) 
the score is 4.5, while for a possibility of using the results in other 
fields it is 3.5, altogether 3.8.

 </td>
 <td width="75%" align=left>9.2 Research goals are objectively
and clearly defined (score 4.8), the plan is feasible (4), 
and can be realized in time (4). The biggest problem of this 
project is that all its coworkers are theoreticians and 
the fourth part of point 9.1 is a pure experiment for which 
no competence is offered, no collaboration with other projects 
is indicated, no equipment is either mentioned or asked for, 
and a realization of the experiment is not mentioned within
methods described in section 9.2. It is therefore unclear to 
me how this part of the project can be realized at all. 
Because of this, although the rest of the project is excellent 
and methods are of a high quality, for the part concerning the
methodology the partial score is 3.5. Total score of the 
section 9.2 is (on average) 4.1.
<br><br>
9.5. Taking into account the above comments I would like to add 
that according to my estimates the other expected results are 
realistically realizable in time with the team and methods 
described in 9.5. It is interesting that here the goals 
promised in 9.4(4) are not mentioned at all, and I am tempted 
to take the whole 9.4(4) section as a mistake. Thus I am 
in a moral dilemma whether to consider this part at all 
and therewith lower the score of otherwise - according to 
my opinion - flawless project. Total score: 4.4.

 <td width="75%" align=left>The head of the project is an 
internationally recognized specialist for the field of 
quantum logic and quantum computation, probably the only 
one who has given significant contributions
to the field in Croatia. Success of his previous research

10.1. Previous discoveries are well presented and the head of the 
project has a pioneering role in some of them, hence the score here 
is clean 5. 
<br><br>
10.2. The head has made real world results in his three previous 
projects, especially in the light of mediocre achievements in 
Croatia and with respect to the conditions in Croatia. The most 
important results and ideas achieved so far will be developed 
further in the present project what shows that the project is 
well founded on the previous investigations. All the 
afore mentioned projects are theoretical and the equipment 
needed by the project boils down to computers that rapidly run 
out of date, but since the program which the project is part of 
as well as the the Croatian academic network have considerable 
resources the project can make use of (SRCE cluster, IRB-GRID 
cluster, Faculty of Civil Engineering cluster), the lack of the 
computing equipment within the project itself is not relevant 
for the project. The bigger problem is that the project lacks 
any equipment (and a request for one) for carrying out 
experiments stated in section 9.1(4) of the project. Because 
of this the score is here 3.9. The total score for this section 
is 4.4.
<br><br>
10.3. The response of the previous research is great and can be 
best recognized by means of the number of citations, through publishing 
in highest quality American Physical Society and Elsevier journals, 
through a Springer invitation to write a book on quantum information and
quantum communication, by means of presentation of some results 
the head of the project obtained in standard textbooks. I am personally 
well acquainted with this part of his work and I do not relay (only) 
on the material supplied with the project. 
<br>The head of the project, the senior coworker D. Bosanac, and 
the PhD student Megill publish their work in American Physical Society 
and Elsevier journals with highest impact factors for their fields 
(up to 6.6), in particular in Phys. Rev. Lett., Phys. Rev. A, Phys Lett. A, 
Phys. Rev. D, and in journal specialized for the fields of theoretical 
quantum information, quantum physics, and quantum chemistry. According 
to the Web of Science (WOS) the papers of D. B. are very well cited 
(over 50 times) and papers the head of the project and his PhD 
student wrote together well for their subfield (up to 15 times). 
Altogether in their careers papers written by the two senior researchers
on the project are cited over 880 time, 400-500 of which it is estimated 
to be relevant to the project. I do not feel competent to evaluate 
the coworker Fresl who is a specialist in the field of civil engineering
but I trust the evaluation of the head of the project that the project 
needs his particular expert knowledge and skill in this interdisciplinary
project. Taken together the citations and presentation of work done by 
the coworkers in books and monographs are very good and the score is 4.6.

logic, quantum algorithms, and quantum error correction) except for 
a scarce contribution to the so-called <i>continuous</i> quantum 
computers through a semi-classical approach to the interaction 
of atoms with electromagnetic field. Including of Croatian research 
novices in the project is not foreseeable although it is asked for.

 <td width="75%" align=left>5.1, 5.2, and 10.5. The WOS basis and the 
enclosed resumes show that the coworkers on the project are competent 
researchers in their fields who publish in top journals and have a good 
response, although they are expert in pretty different fields. Thus the
team is competent in the graphic-information, mathematical, quantum-chemical, 
and quantum-information fields, what I take to be a well balanced team 
for carrying out the tasks of this multidisciplinary project and the 
foreseen theoretical and computational goals. Again the complete 
mystery is the task 9.1(4) which does not appear to fit into the
project and for which the team does not appear to be competent. 
This part of the project lowers the score for this which would otherwise 
be higher. The score is 4.4. 
<br><br>10.4. There are no records that the head of the project has been 
a mentor to postgraduate students. He is now a mentor to a PhD student
Megill. Another postgraduate student is asked for the project but the 
details of his/her work within it are not too elaborated. Hence a 
cautious score here: 3.8

The reader would now expect that the scientific committee 
has taken the referees' evaluations and proposals into account 
and proposed the Ministry to support the project.  
Mladen Pavicic has himself been a referee for similar project 
proposals in USA, Israel, Australia, Italy and Croatia  
and taking referees' evaluations and proposals into 
account has been a rule. He is also a permanent referee for the 
<i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i>, (more then 20 refereed manuscripts
so far) and <i>Phys. Rev. A</i> (also more than 20) and 
an occasional one for the <i>Optics Commun., 
J. Phys. A, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B, Int. J.
Theor. Phys.</i> and others, and he long ago found that 
taking referees' evaluations and proposals is again 
a rule. A referee can be overvoted by two other referees, 
but eventually evaluations and proposals of some 
referees who are specialists in a chosen field are taken
into account.
