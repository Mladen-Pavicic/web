</h2>

<br><br>
At the end of 2006 the <i> Ministry of Science, Education, 
and Sport</i> (the <i>Ministry</i> for short) following a 
proposal of its <i> Scientific Board for Physics</i> 
approved budgets for 72 project proposals in physics. 

<br><br>

The only project in the field of quantum computation
in Croatia, i.e., <b> <font color="#550055">Mladen Pavicic</font>, 
<font color="#331199"><i>Quantum Computation: Parallelism and 
Visualization</font></i></b>
is not among them although two referees (one from Croatia 
and one from abroad) gave the proposal the average of 
4.3 scores out of 5 possible ones and advised the 
<i>Scientific Board</i> to propose the <i>Ministry</i> to 
budget the project. As it is well-known, the field is one 
the most propulsive and the fastest growing 
(multidisciplinary) research fields in the World (each 
year more and more billions of dollars are put into it). 
To evaluate how important the field is taken to be by 
the physics community in the World it suffices to see 
how big is the section <i>Quantum Information</i> in the 
<i>Physical Review A</i>. 


<br><br>
The <i>Scientific Board</i> rejected the positive evaluation 
of the referees and their advice to accept the project 
without giving a reason or argument for doing so and 
without laying down any methodology that would approve 
such a decision. 

<br><br>
Since picking out the projects a state should budget 
and therefore defining scientific priorities is a 
very serious matter for the whole state and for each 
active and would-be scientist in it, I hold that 
the methodology of approving submitted projects 
should open and transparent and moreover, one project 
period (5 years) in advance. 

<br><br>
I asked for a clarification at the <i>Ministry</i> 
and the enclosed reply I received from it indicates 
that the decision of making a list of projects to be 
budgeted was left entirely to the <i>Scientific 
board</i>. I contacted the  members of the 
<i>Scientific Board</i> and 
they provided me with no further information or 
clue on their proposed list apart from some 
indications that they put the main weight on Impact 
Factors and citations. 

<br><br>
Since I would like to get a budget for the project 
eventually, I thought it would be viable to make the
following comparative analysis with respect to 
available data on the project and the coworkers who 
would work on it, on the one hand, and the 72 
projects accepted to be budgeted, on the other. 
Its aim is to inform both our future evaluators and 
our colleagues in the World why our first attempt to 
get a budget failed. I believe this would speed up 
a recovery from damage the decision made by the 
<i>Scientific Board</i> inflicted on the research 
started for the project. 

<blockquote>
The details of the decision are as follows.
<br>
<blockquote>
The <i>Scientific Board</i> "<i>fully</i>" accepts 
the referees' evaluation of the following project parts:
<blockquote>
- Hypothesis and aims of the proposed research: 4.2
scores of 5 possible ones
<br>
- Plan and methodology of research: 4.13
<br>
- Feasibility of the project with the help of the 
existing equipment and available premises: 4.90; 
<br>
- Evaluation of the budget the project asks for: 4.5.
</blockquote>

The <i>Scientific Board</i> "<i>fully</i>" rejects
the referees' evaluation of the following project parts:
<br>
<blockquote>
- Competence of the head of the project: the scores 
of the referees - <b><font color=green>5.00</font></b> and  
<b><font color=green>4.66</font></b> -
the <i>Scientific Board</i> 
 <b><i><font color=#DD0000>"corrects"</font></i></b>
with a  "factor of scientific productivity and impact of 
the head within the previous project period (2002-06)" to 
<b><font color=#DD0000>2</font></b>;
<br>
- Competence of the coworkers of the project: 
the scores of the referees - 
<b><font color=green>2.5</font></b> and 
<b><font color=green>4.1</font></b>, 
the <i>Scientific Board</i> 
<b><i><font color=#DD0000>"corrects"</font></i></b>
with a  "factor of scientific productivity and impact of 
the team within the previous project period (2002-06)"  
to <b><font color=#DD0000>2</font></b>.
</blockquote>
The <i>Scientific Board</i> fully 
<b><i><font color=#DD0000>rejects</font></i></b> 
<b><font color=green>advices of both referees to approve 
the budget for the project</font></b> and for this it 
offers the following clarification: 
<blockquote>
- The average scores of the competence of the head 
and the coworkers of the project has <b><i><font color=#DD0000> 
after correction </font></i></b> with a factor of 
international impact in the previous project 
period <b><i><font color=#DD0000> 
fallen below the passing level</font></i></b>. 
</blockquote></blockquote>

Besides, the <i>Scientific Board</i> comes to an 
unbelievable idea to utter the following "recommendation:" 
"M. Pavicic and S. Bosanac 
<b><i><font color=#DD0000> could concentrate themselves to the
work on two other projects they take part in</font></i></b>: 
M. Pavicic on the project No. 208 by M. Stipcevic and S. Bosanac 
on the project No. 1129 by N. Doslic." 

<br><br>
The <i>Scientific Board</i> greatly oversteps its authorization
when advising Pavicic and Bosanac what to engage themselves in. 
And just for the reader's information, the present project 
scarcely overlaps with the other two mentioned projects. 
Some results of one quarter of the project and only in 
the 4th and 5th year of research should be experimentally 
checked within the project 208 (if it obtains the equipment). 
There is no overlapping with the project 1129. 
</blockquote>
Let us now analyse the decision made by the 
 <i>Scientific Board</i> starting from available 
data and facts. The <i>Scientific Board</i> rejected 
the project by rejecting the referees' evaluations of 
the competences of the head and coworkers of the 
project and therefore we have start with the latter
competences <font color="#CC66DD">(disregarding the 
complete absurdity of the simultaneous acceptance of 
the referees' evaluation of all the other parts of 
the project on the part of the <i>Scientific Board</i>)</font>. 
In the end, we are going to make a comparison of the 
head and team of this project with the heads of the 
72 approved projects (since data on the teams of the 
projects are not available). 
<blockquote>
The head of the project, Mladen Pavicic, according 
to the evaluation of the referees,  
<blockquote>
(1st Referee)  <b><font color=green>"<td width="75%" 
align=left>is an internationally 
recognized specialist for the field of 
quantum logic and quantum computation, probably the only 
one who has given significant contributions to the field 
in Croatia. Success of his previous research is reflected 
in numerous (39) Current Contents paper in quality journal 
and invited talks (70). He is a permanent referee for 
<i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> and <i>Phys. Rev A</i>."
</font></b>
<br><br>
(2nd Referee) <b><font color=green>"has made real world 
results in his three previous projects, especially in 
the light of mediocre achievements in Croatia and with 
respect to the conditions in Croatia. The most 
important results and ideas achieved so far will be developed 
further in the present project... has himself taken a 
pioneering part in some of the results. His connections and 
cooperation with some of the best scientists in the field and his 
recognized charisma (<i>Springer</i> invitation to write a 
book, permanent referee for <i>American Physical Society 
journals</i>, leader of the <i>Croatian Humboldt-Club</i>) 
show that he is an exceptionally capable 
scientist who definitely deserves his own research project."
</font></b> 
</blockquote>

The head of the project has made over 10 important discoveries 
in the last 20 years in the following fields: 
quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum 
optics, quantum mechanics, quantum logic, Hilbert 
space theory, Hilbert lattice theory, and orthomodular 
lattice theory. He has written 59 refereed publications 
(37 Current Contents papers, 17 papers in international
proceedings, 3 books, 2 chapters in books), he hes been cited 
over 250 times, has been the head of three previous projects 
(1991-96, 1996-2001, 2002-2006) at the <i>Ministry</i> 
and of one foreign project, has been a coworker in several 
foreign projects, etc. 

<br><br>
In the "previous project period" (2002-06) the head of the 
project  
<blockquote>
- made and published - together with his coworker  N.D. Megill - 
several important discoveries in the field of the Hilbert 
space and lattice and orthomodular lattices.
<br>
- conceived the algorithm and together with his coworkers 
B. D. McKay, N.D. Megill and J.-P. Merlet elaborated and 
developed it into programs so as to yield exhaustive 
generation of Kochen-Specker vectors which correspond to  
measurement  results that cannot be obtained by carrying 
out measurements on classical systems - the problem which
has been an open question for decades and which filled  
the journals (from <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> on) with  
individual partial solutions. 
<br>
- 2002-06 reviewed 18 papers for <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i>,
17 for <i>Phys. Rev. A</i> i several for <i>J. Phys. A</i>, 
<i>J. Opt. Soc. Am.B</i>, and <i>Optics Commun.</i>
<br>
- upon invitation by the editor wrote the book M. Pavicic, 
<i>Quantum Computation and Quantum Communication</i>, Springer, 
New York, 2005 
<br>
- upon invitations by the editors wrote chapters for 
two <i>Handbooks</i>, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006 in the fields 
of quantum logic and quantum computation
<br>
- 2001-05 was the president of the <i>Croatian 
Humboldt-Club</i> 
<br>
- organized two international conferences in 2002
<br>
- organized four domestic conferences (2003-05)
<br>
- edited and published an international proceedings in 2002

<font color="#0000FF">Here the reader might wonder 
how come the <i>Scientific Board</i> rejected such a 
project with such co-workers in spite of the positive
evaluation of the referees and their recommendation to 
the <i>Scientific Board</i> to accept the project. 
The project boasts the creative excellence and would 
stimulate the scientific community in the World and 
Croatia.</font> Yet, the <i>Scientific Board</i> 
writes about <font color=#DD0000>
insufficient "international response and production
in the previous project period (2002-06)."</font> 
<br><br>
<font color=green>The <i>Scientific Board</i> has not
defined what the</font>  
<font color=#DD0000>"international response and production"
</font>
<font color=green>should be. They disregarded the 
"international response and production" the referees 
point out, so, they obviously mean something else. 
With reference to e-mails I received from two members 
of the <i>Scientific Board</i> I can guess that the 
"international response and production" boils to 
citations in Current Contents journals, to Impact Factors and to 
the number of Current Contents papers. We therefore introduce the 
following definitions of these "factors" in accordance 
to international bibliometric standards.</font>  
<blockquote>
<font color=#DD0000>CC</font> is a <i>normed number of Current Contents  
papers</i> per co-author in the following sense: 
if an author takes part in writing one paper together with  
49 co-authors, two papers with 6 co-authors each and 
one paper with one co-author, then his/her  
<font color=#DD0000>CC</font>=1/50+2/7+1/2=<font color=#DD0000>0.81</font>. 
<br>
<font color=#DD0000>CC</font> measures the productivity of each 
co-author. 
<br><br>
<font color=#DD0000>IF</font> is a <i> normed Impact Factor</i>, 
i.e., an average "impact" per each co-author in the following 
sense: if an author takes part in writing one paper in 
a Current Contents journal with Impact Factor 7.489 
together with 49 co-authors, two papers with Impact Factor
2.9976 with 6 co-authors each and one paper with 
Impact Factor 0.632 with one co-author, then his/her 
<font color=#DD0000>IF</font>=7.489/50+2x2.997/7+0.632/2=<font 
color=#DD0000>1.32</font>. 
<br>
<font color=#DD0000>IF</font> 
measures the "impact" of each co-author.

<br><br>
Ratio <font color=#DD0000>IF</font>/<font color=#DD0000>CC</font> 
is characteristic of the subfield an author works in 
but not for the "popularity" of the author him/herself and/or 
his results. For this, an indication offers the following
citation factor.
<br><br>
<font color=#DD0000>CIT</font> is a <i>normed number of 
citations in Current Contents papers without 
self-citation and without cross self-citation</i> per 
each co-author in the following sense: if a an author 
takes part in writing  
<blockquote>- one paper together with 49 co-authors
and this paper gets cited 80 times whereof 17 
citations are made by co-authors of this paper, 
<br>
- two papers each with 6 different co-authors and 
the first paper gets cited only once by one of the co-authors 
of the second paper and the second paper gets cited only 
once by one of the co-authors of the first paper and 
<br>
- one paper with one co-author which gets cited twice 
by authors who never appear as co-authors of the author,
</blockquote>
then 
<font color=#DD0000>CIT</font>=63/50+0/7+0/7+2/2=<font color=#DD0000>2.26</font>.
<br>
<font color=#DD0000>CIT</font> measures the "popularity" of an 
author and/or his/her results with scientists in the 
same field around the Globe.
<br><br>
</blockquote>

We have calculated <font color=#DD0000>CC</font>, 
<font color=#DD0000>IF</font> and  
<font color=#DD0000>CIT</font> for the period Jan 2002 - Mar 2007
for the head and all co-workers of our project 
and for all heads of the 72 projects in physics accepted by 
the <i>Ministry</i> upon a recommendation by the 
<Scientific Board</i> and compared them in the

<br>Links to rank lists according to <font color=#DD0000>CC</font>, 
<font color=#DD0000>IF</font> and
<font color=#DD0000>CIT</font> for the period Jan 2002 - Mar 2007
for each head of the accepted 72 projects can be found 
near the bottom of this page.  

<br><br>
As we can see, the head and the co-workers and 
all together are better then at least 18 and at most 
51 heads of the accepted projects. We have also tried 
various other combinations and definitions of Impact
Factors, Current Contents and citations but could not 
<i>win</i> the last (73rd) place. 

<br><br>
Of course, such bibliometric rank lists are always 
inherently inconsistent. On the one hand, for 
interdisciplinary projects Current Contents are 
not a priori significant. For instance, for 
mathematics and information science 
are not particularly important (McKay and Merlet 
have got the majority of papers and citations outside  
of Current Contents journals) and for civil engineering
they are barely important (Fresl). On the other hand,  
inside physics itself Impact Factors and the number of 
Current Contents papers per year for mathematical 
and theoretical physics (Pavicic, Bosanac, Megill) 
are typically much lower and citations slower then, 
e.g., for astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle
physics.
 <br><br>

<font color=blue>To rely exclusively on such mechanical 
bibliometric comparison while making scientific
priorities for a state and reject complex and
individual analysis of referees as well as available 
data on the quality and originality of previous and 
current scientific work of the heads of proposed 
projects and their co-workers is a very worrying and 
disturbing idea. Besides, this is in sharp contradiction
with the "importance of the referees for evaluating
the projects" the <i>Ministry</i> repeatedly
empahsized in the media. 
</font>  

<br><br>
<font color=#DD0000>However, there are even more worrying 
side of the present "case." Specifically, it is not only 
that  the <i>Scientific Board</i> has not taken the 
evaluations and recommendations of the referees into 
account contrary to the emphasis of the <i>Ministry</i> 
and it is not only that it has not made its 
criteria public and that it has introduced them 
at its own will and without a consensus of the 
scientific community, but also that the <i>Scientific 
Board</i> apparently (as follows from the above comparison
and the jumble CC, IF, and CIT make in the "72 ranking") 
has not applied unique criteria to all project proposals
and this is even more worrying and disturbing.

<i>The Race for Quality</i></a>. 
It is so appropriate for the above story that I thought 
it would be viable to copy the editorial introduction here. 
In particular because it speaks about "the consequences of 
rampant evaluation fever" and warns that "to an ever 
increasing degree, quality reviews are turning into a 
race for funding and reputation."

<br><br>

<b><i>In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is a king. 
This also seems to apply to the methods commonly used to 
measure academic quality. Reviewers are commissioned, 
publications and citations are counted, and journals are checked 
to see if papers have been published in them and if so, what 
the volume of readership is like. Of course, reviewers may be 
wrong occasionally. And there are things that simply can't be 
expressed by indexes which, moreover, are not immune to 
manipulation. But alternative methods of measuring research 
are not at hand. <font color=green>So one has to make the 
best of methods available, for instance by tailoring them 
to different disciplines and doing justice to individual 
cases.</font> Chemist Roland Fischer gives an account of 
how this is done in the Humboldt Foundation's Selection 
Committee as an example. 

<br><br>
 
The consequences of rampant evaluation fever, 
"evaluations," as the Science Council's Secretary General 
Wedig von Heyden calls it in this issue, are just as 
interesting as the proper methods. To an ever increasing 
degree, quality reviews are turning into a race for funding 
and reputation. While sciences and the humanities certainly 
aren't a hundred-metre race, the Olympic motto of "faster, 
higher, further" seems to count more and more in research. 
Here, good research and teaching need not necessarily be 
the winners. Unlike world records in sport, the desire to 
measure the achievements even of a research's entire 
lifetime and possibly express them in a single figure, as 
is the case with the Hirsch Index, tends to produce bizarre 
results. 


<br><br>
<font color=green>
Quality just happens to be a question of individuality and 
originality, as the topic of the leading articles shows. 
For instance, it is worthwhile for academics to try out 
swimming against the tide when choosing their research 
topics. And those taking a break from the hunt for 
quantifiable research achievements in order to allow for 
some unhurried academic activity may find that apparent 
idleness and patient trial and error, whether in the 
laboratory or at the desk, can sometimes yield the best ideas.
