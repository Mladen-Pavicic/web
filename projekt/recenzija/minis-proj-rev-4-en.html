<br><br>
Dear Sir/Madam, 

<br><br>
More than two and a half months ago I filed the enclosed appeal 
but I still have not received your decision. I also sent you 
two reminders, four weeks and ten days ago. 

<br><br>
What I have received from the Ministry is a letter (which arrived 
on June 27, 2007 and carries the date of June 19, 2007) 
by the Assistant Minister for Science Dr. Andrea Tomljenovic. 
The letter is not a formal decision and it does not satisfy 
basic standards of processing and respecting an appeal 
which has been officially filed and to which substantial arguments 
has been supplied. 

<br><br>
The letter does not contain any reference to the arguments given in 
and evidences supplied to our appeal. The appeal itself is 
referred to by the bare <i><font color=#DD0000>"we have considered 
it"</font></i>. Immediately thereupon it is claimed that the 
evaluation procedure of scientific-project and -programme proposals 
has been carried out  <i><font color=#DD0000>"in complete accordance 
with the evaluation procedure in the countries of the European 
Union"</font></i>.  


<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">D e t a i l s</H2>

Our appeal points to the following irregular and unacceptable
behaviours of the Scientific Board and provides arguments for
rejecting its proposal and accepting the proposals of the 
referees instead.

<blockquote>
1. The <i>Scientific Board</i> rejected the positive evaluation 
of the referees and their advice to accept the project 
as well as numerous available evidences of the high 
scientific quality of the work done by the the head of the 
project and his coworkers;  <i><font color=#DD0000> does the 
Ministry really want to claim this is "in complete accordance 
with the evaluation procedure in the countries of the European 
Union"</font></i>. 

<br><br>
2. The <i>Scientific Board</i> still has not revealed its 
criteria and it acted out of accord with the physics community
and at odds with the proclaimed policy of the Ministry 
to leave the evaluation of project proposals to the 
referees;  <i><font color=#DD0000> does the Ministry really want 
to claim this is "in complete accordance with the evaluation 
procedure in the countries of the European Union"</font></i>.  

<br><br>
3. From our analysis and comparison of all 72 accepted projects
with our project it turns out that the <i>Scientific Board</i>
has not treated our and other projects equally; moreover,  
according to alleged criteria of the <i>Scientific Board</i>
our project should be ranked close to the middle of the 
list of the accepted projects;  <i><font color=#DD0000> does the 
Ministry really want to claim this is "in complete accordance 
with the evaluation procedure in the countries of the European 
Union"</font></i>.  
</blockquote>

Taken all this into account together with the detailed 
analysis of all the accepted projects we carried out 
and which is available at 
<blockquote>
<a href="/pavicic/projekt/" target="_blank">
http://m3k.grad.hr/pavicic/projekt/</a>
</blockquote>
we propose to the Ministry
<blockquote>
<b><font color=green>
1. to send the revised version (3380) of our project to 
the those referees who already reviewed the original 
version of the project (1184);

<br><br>
2.<b><font color=#DD0000> <i> not to accept </font></i></b>
a rejection of referees' evaluations on the part of the 
<i>Scientific Board</i>;

<br><br>
3. to rank our project between 72 previously accepted ones in 
order to compensate the hardships inflicted on our project 
by the <i>Scientific Board</i> through their inappropriate 
rejection of referees' evaluations;

<br><br>
4. to approve a five-year span for the project (as given 
to all previous projects under programs) and to approve 
integrating the project with the other projects under the 
program <i>Distributed Processing and Scientific Data 
Visualization</i> headed by Karolj Skala; this is how we 
originally submitted the project;

<br><br>
5. to allow us (upon receiving referees' evaluations) to 
submit a request for equipment needed for the project after
the deadline taking into account that the <i>Scientific 
Board</i> through their inappropriate rejection of referees' 
evaluations prevented us from doing so in time;  

<br><br>
6. to already now at the beginning of the new project period 
has the way of and criteria for the evaluation of the 
projects defined as well set up the criteria for approving 
new ones afterwards.
</font></b>
</blockquote>

<br><br>
We kindly ask you to reach your decision on our appeal 
as soon as possible and point by point with explanations 
and verifiable arguments for each point 
<b><font color=green> in accordance with the evaluation 
procedure in the countries of the European Union
</font></b>. Under this we understand that a body of the 
Ministry, in our case the <i>Council of the Science 
Department</i> consisting of men and women with names, 
out our appeal at the agenda of one of its meeting, 
consider it, reach a decision, and pass the decision 
together with the minutes

<br><br>
We think that such a procedure what is expected of the 
Ministry of Science in particular to substantiate its 
proclaimed policy of contributing to the future and 
development of our country <b><i><font color=green>"based 
on knowledge"</font></i></b> and  <b><i><font color=green> 
in accordance with the evaluation procedures of 
scientific-project proposal in the countries of the 
European Union and USA"</font></i>. I am (and/or has been) 
a referee for evaluation and approval of federal and 
national scientific projects on four continents, a referee 
for top international publishers, a supervisor of other 
referees' evaluations, a member of several international 
associations and societies, co-founder of one international 
association with headquarters in USA, and I can claim 
that have never and nowhere come across of a case where 
a substantiated analysis and appeal hes been dismissed 
with nothing but four words: <b><i><font color=#DD0000>"we have 
considered it"</font></i></b>.
