It is shown that the identity rule - a rule of inference 
which has the form of modus ponens but with the operation 
of identity substituted for the operation of 
implication - turns any ortholattice into either 
an orthomodular lattice (a model of a quantum theory) or 
a distributive lattice (a model of classical theory). 
It is also shown that - as opposed to the implication 
algebras - one cannot construct an identity algebra 
although the identity rule contains the operation of 
identity as the only operation.
