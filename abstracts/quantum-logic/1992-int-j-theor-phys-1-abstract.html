The bibliography contains 1851 references on axiomatic 
structures underlying quantum mechanics with a stress on varietes
of algebraico-logical, probabilistic, and operational structures for 
which the term <i> quantum logics </i> is adopted. An index of about 
250 keywords picked out from the titles is included and statistics 
about papers, journals, and authors are presented. Monographs and 
proceedings on the subject are singled out.
