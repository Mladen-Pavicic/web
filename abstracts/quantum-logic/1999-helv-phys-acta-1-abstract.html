It is shown that propositional calculuses of both quantum and 
classical logics are non-categorical. We find that quantum logic 
is in addition to an orthomodular lattice also modeled by a weakly 
orthomodular lattice and that classical logic is in addition to a 
Boolean algebra also modeled by a weakly distributive lattice. Both
new models turn out to be non-orthomodular. We prove the soundness
and completeness of the calculuses for the models. We also prove 
that all the operations in an orthomodular lattice are five-fold 
defined. In the end we discuss possible repercussions
of our results to quantum computations and quantum computers.
