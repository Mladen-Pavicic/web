Dear Professor Pavicic,

<br><br>
we have considered your statement on the report of the 
Scientific Board and we want to inform you that the evaluation 
procedure of scientific-project and -programme proposals 
has been carried out according to the standards for selection
of scientific projects and programmes that are in complete 
accordance with the evaluation procedure in the countries 
of the European Union.  

<br><br>
Scientific Boards, completely independent of the Ministry, 
carried out the whole evaluation procedure. Consequently, 
based on the instructions to referees and  
Scientific Boards (Evaluation Groups), accepted by the 
National Council for Science and available on the 
Ministry web pages 
<A HREF="http://zprojekti.mzos.hr/page.aspx?pid=57&lid=1" target="_blank">
<i> scientific projects</i></a>, the Scientific Board 
for Physics rejects the project with particular recommendations
to the head of the project. 

<br><br>
Your submission of the revised version  of the project 
will be evaluated as all the other submissions  
of scientific-project and -programme proposals. 

<br><br>
Yours sincerely

<br><br>
Assistant Minister for Science


<br><br>
Andrea Tomljenovic, PhD
