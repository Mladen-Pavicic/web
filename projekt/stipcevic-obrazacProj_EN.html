				Entanglement is a unique quantum mechanical resource that plays a key role in many applications of quantum computation and communication. A member of our group (M. Pavicic) provided a theory of two- and four photon entanglement [Pavicic, M., Phys. Rev. A 50 (1994); 3486, Pavicic, M. and J. Summhammer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 73 (1994); 3191, Pavicic, M., J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 12 (1995); 821]. Subsequent experiments with  entangled photons opened a whole field of research on the foundations of quantum mechanics in spite of the low efficiency of the down-conversion processes which are the main sources of entangled photons. Practical quantum communication implementations, however, require as high a yield of the down-conversion processes as possible. We will address this question by probing new types of nonlinear crystals, using quantum cavities and femtosecond laser pulse techniques as well as investigating possibilities of building miniature entangled photon sources.

In 1984 C. Bennett and H. Brassard published a scenario in which laws of quantum physics are used to construct a novel cryptographic protocol which enables secret communication between two parties. This so called &quot;quantum cryptography&quot; (QC) has developed into a major field of research. Today the main problems of the QC are limited range, limited secret key rate and multi-party communication. To improve the performance of quantum cryptographic systems a number of challenging multi-disciplinary topics has to be addressed. The ones we are going to address are: efficient photon entanglement, quantum repeater, high efficiency single photon detectors and construction of new quantum cryptographic protocols.

Another feature of quantum systems we are going to address with the same experimental equipment as well as theoretically is the evolution of quantum systems in time, in particular when they are in a superposition. We are going to carry out quantum interrogation experiments within a photon resonator as proposed by Pavicic, Phys. Lett. A 223 (1996); 241  and Paul, H. and Pavicic, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 14 (1996); 1275. Our aim is to measure time a photon takes to build and destroy interference. This issue is especially important for quantum computation where superpositions of states are essential for the computational speed-up. Therefore we shall also design a full photon interrogation CNOT atom-photon quantum gate using the resonator.</P>

				Four focuses of this project are: entanglement, quantum cryptography, logic gates for quantum computing and photon detectors. 
 
We plan to begin with research of the phenomenon of entanglement. To that end we will build a laboratory setup for production of type-II polarization entangled photon pairs. The goal of this would be to investigate new methods for efficient photon entanglement with help of new nonlinear crystals, new sources of light, repeated usage of the same crystal, resonators and technology of femtosecond laser pulses. For some of this techniques it will be necessary to gain further theoretical insight and/or perform extensive numerical simulations, in which our group is well educated and experienced. We expect to achieve a setup for entangled photon production with fairly improved performances in terms of intensity, entanglement purity, spectral width and walk-off.

In collaboration with our colleagues from the LMU Muenchen, we will investigate a new techniques for multi-photon entanglement. This research is importat for better understanding of the entanglement, and perhaps it may lead to the solution of the problem of limited range of the quantum communication.

Very important element of our research are new techniques of detection of single photons, because the photons are our basic tool for probing the laws of quantum mechanics. So far we already have a very promising result in technique for active quenching in silicon avalanche photo diodes. Our preliminary prototype exhibits very small dead time (better than commercial devices) and very small autocorrelation, however additional measurements are required to verify the result and to further optimize the circuit. Both parameters (dead time, autocorrelation) are important for both loophole-free testing of basic laws of quantum physics and for generating of random numbers based on measurements of random quantum processes which result in photon emission.  

Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and associated active and passive quenching circuits, and gated operation will be examined. Instrumentation and methods suitable for single-photon-counting and time-correlated photon-counting will be defined.

For characterization of single photon detectors we will use the following methods: measurement of dead time, measurement of the response time and its dispersion, afterpulsing, autocorrelation and other.
  
Time interval measurement methods, with picosecond resolution for timing characterization (time response, time spread, propagation time, timing jitter etc.) of high speed pulsed signals will be used.

Our previous experience in the field of timing measurement is precondition for expected applications in development of high-end electronic and optoelectronic devices for scientific measurement, quantum information and quantum communication  applications. 

We will continue our previous and very successful (see 10.3) theoretical and experimental research of random number (random bit) generators.  We will use advanced randomness tests for testing randomness of binary sequences produced by such generators. The key element for practical realization of these generators are single photon detectors.

For a loophole-free Bell test with entangled atoms Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003); 110405, in which we collaborate with the group of prof. H. Weinfurter from the LMU Muenchen, in is necessary to develop a new type of generator that would be capable of producing a random number in a very short time upon a request. For that particular application high repetitiveness, that is production rate, is not necessary. Most existing methods for generation of random numbers follow the exponential statistics and therefore there is no guarantee that the random number will be generated within a specified time period, a feature that is most desirable for this purpose. We expect to be able to devise such a generator.

Efficient photon detectors with a low dead time are also important for our next goal: apparatus for quantum cryptography. Quantum cryptography, as opposed to classical cryptography which is currently in wide use, has a potential of making possible a perfectly secret communication. But its big unsolved problems are limited communication range and speed. Because of exponential weakening of efficiency of communication , these problems cannot be solved solely on technological basis but the additional scientific research is required, in which we plan to give our contribution. 

For start, we plan to build a quantum cryptographic setup based upon a modified BB84 protocol for which only one electro optical modulator is required. By modifying this basic setup we will be able  to investigate  various new experimental techniques and new protocols, some of which include use of entangled photon pairs, reference to classical (Shannon) information theory and quantum information theory, and theoretical results in the field of binary noisy channels.

We plan to realize free-space quantum communication during the night and also investigate possibilities to establish the quantum communication during the day. Namely, communication during the day, in the presence of a large background from the sunlight is a big challenge and up to now only pioneering attempts exist in that area. 

Also we plan to investigate, at least theoretically, ways to realize &quot;quantum switchboard&quot; that would make possible quantum communication among a number of participants without quadratic expansion of required number of quantum channels. 

Our noted theoretical work on quantum computing Phys. Lett. A 223 (1996); 241, concerning CNOT quantum logic gates has not yet been fully exploited experimentally. In the heart of these gates is a photonic resonator whose experimental realization is fairly demanding. This proposal opens some deep fundamental questions to which only experiment can give a decisive answer. 

To that end we will consider building a quantum interrogation CNOT as well as a probabilistic all-optical CNOT gate which can be used for building a quantum repeater.

Finally it is important to remark that some of the proposed research can lead to generation of innovations. In such event adequate measures for protection of the IPR will be taken.</P>

				The aim of the proposed research is to investigate experimentally and theoretically some new or insufficiently investigated quantum phenomena.

One of the basic tools for the experiments in the quantum information is the device for production of entangled photons, mostly polarization entangled photon pairs. Current setups based on downconverson do not have very good performances but there are strong indications that by use of novel nonlinear crystals and blue lasers one could obtain significant improvements. Some newer works point at the possibility of improving performance of the downconversion by use of resonators. We plan to get involved in this research.

We expect to be able to advance experimentally and theoretically protocols for quantum cryptography, in the sense of increased communication speed, range and robustness to technical failures and eavesdropping. To that end our research interest will comprise dense quantum coding, quantum error correction, entanglement distillation, quantum repeaters, information theory and cryptographic protocols with noisy binary channels. We will also look for completely new quantum cryptographic protocols.

In continuation to our previous results we will investigate new principles for building of quantum random number generators.

We will investigate the new possibilities of experimental realization of theoretical setups or predictions which have not yet been experimentally verified. One such example are the CNOT quantum logic gates described in one of our recent theoretical papers.

We will be interested in insufficiently explored effects in semiconductor photon detectors as well as electronic circuits for active quenching of electronic avalanche.

In this field of science, a path between basic research and outskirts of very useful technologies is unusually short. This is even more interesting because the informatics and communication, for which the proposed research is relevant, have marked the age in which we live.

This project introduces to our community one hot, interdisciplinary topic, rich with up-to-date experimental techniques (lasers, quantum optics, compact photonic detectors, optic fibers etc.) that are widely applicable also outside of laboratories for quantum physics. Techniques we use and develop within the scope of this project will be a foundation for the cooperation with other projects within the program NT-AMOP. Such a project gives a good opportunity for work and education of young researches.</P>

				Possible direct applications of scientific research proposed here include: cryptography, computer security, technology of communication by light and optic fibers (light guides), new techniques of super-compression of data, various measurement techniques and in the computer technology. 

In the last few years research and practical devices for quantum cryptography have been increasingly financed by many prestigious scientific and technological programs and institutions (FP6, ESA, NATO, DARPA, NSF, venture capital...). Two years ago first commercial quantum cryptographic products and patents have been presented, thus it is plain to see that it is a new, emerging technology with a big potential of growth. This is not a surprise if one only takes into account that fully functional quantum cryptography would solve two burning problems of the information society: the problem of communicating in perfect secrecy and problem of capacity of communication by light.

Quantum random number generators find their application in cryptography, numerical simulations and research. First products have appeared on the market two years ago and present an important emerging technology.
 
New miniature and robust photon detectors, based on silicon semiconductor technology (silicon avalanche photodiodes) are finding their use in spectrophotometry, confocal microscopy, bacteria and dust detectors, fast DNA sequencing, measurement equipment for the technology of optic fibers and communications by light (OTDR) and in various photo-diagnostic and phototherapeutic methods in medicine such as: diagnostic of micro caries, diagnostic of malign skin tumors, photodynamic therapy and PET tomography. Whenever possible, we plan to bring eventual innovations to the stage of commercial pre-prototype and take steps to protect the intellectual rights, using alternative funds. Funds for IPR protection and for development of prototypes will be sought in the realm of technological projects and through collaboration with the industry. We see a great possibility to collaborate with other projects within the program NT-AMOP in the domain of photon detectors. 

In the previous five years period we had two successful innovations relevant for the scope of this project (se 10.3) which clearly illustrates the potential of this project proposal for generating new technologies.</P>

We are upgrading a computerized system for controlling and monitoring  of experiments locally and over the web. The system will have the capability of autonomous performing of programmable series of measurements.

The setup for photon pair entanglement is used for testing foundations of quantum physics.

We will test silicon avalanche photodiodes (SPAD) and develop microelectronic circuits for passive and active quenching and for gated operation. Instrumentation and methods for photon detection and counting will be defined.
 
We hope to be able to measure absolute quantum efficiency of single photon detectors, using pairwise entangled photons.

For SPA diodes we will measure probability of afterpulsing, autocorrelation and timing characteristics and investigate influence of these effects on various applications such as measurement of correlations of entangled photons and quantum cryptography.

In this or the next year we envisage possibility of involvement in technological projects.

				The four parts of our project:
1. photon interferometry,
2. quantum cryptography,
3. silicon photon detectors and
4. engineering of quantum states related to quantum computation, are based on the following previous discoveries: 

1. We will mention just a few technical discoveries our experiments will be based on. Polarization entanglement between two originally unpolarized or polarized photons after their interaction at a beam splitter [Pavicic, M., Phys. Rev. A 50 (1994); 3486]. Polarization entanglement in a type-II downconversion [Kwiat, P. G., Mattle, K., Weinfurter, H., et al., Phys. Rev. Let. 75 (1995); 4337, Pavicic, M. and J. Summhammer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 73 (1994); 3191, Pavicic, M., J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 12 (1995); 821].

2.  Quantum cryptography conceived by F. Bennett and G. Brassard in 1984, which makes eavesdropping impossible, was recently (2003) implemented in the quantum DARPA network: Harward-Boston, 29km. Whether the network could be extended over much larger distances, depends on whether we could make efficient quantum repeaters [see ref in 10.5.4, pp. 151-159]. We will consider hyperentanglement [P. G. Kwiat and H. Weinfurter, Phys. Rev. A 58 (1998); R2623, C. Cinelli et al, Laser Physics 15 (2005); 124] and all-optical CNOT gates [P. Kok et al., Phys. Rev. A 66 (2002); 063814] for the purpose. We will also address the efficiency of the main photon sources for cryptography: the downconversion crystals [P.S.K. Lee et al., Phys. Rev. A 70 (2004); 043818].

3. Compact single photon detectors based on avalanche photodiodes play an important role quantum information research and are a hot research topic themselves [Cova S. et al. J. Mod. Optic. 51 (2004); 1267-1288].

4. Engineering and controlling atom states and their superposition and properties by  means of interaction with photons is essential for both quantum cryptography and quantum computing. Many of the recent setups are carried out the help of a cavity (resonator). We are going to carry out a quantum interrogation experiment to investigate on time windows a photon takes to build and destroy an interference within a resonator [Pavicic, M., Phys. Lett. A 223 (1996); 241, Paul, H. and Pavicic, M., J.Opt. Soc. Am. B 14 (1997); 1275]. We will also consider building a quantum interrogation CNOT as well as a probabilistic all-optical CNOT gate which can be used for building a quantum repeater [T. B. Pittman, B.C. Jacobs, and J.D. Franson, Phys. Rev A 64 (2001); 062311].</P>

				This project benefits from previous research made within several multi-disciplinary projects.

Dr. Mario Stipčević, the leader of this project has lead several projects concerning quantum information and classical cryptography: &quot;System for secure transfer of data over the Internet using random numbers and CGI technology &quot;, CARNet contract No. 650-103/03 (2003-2004), &quot;Secure web server with individualized access to a database &quot;, Ministry of science and technology of Republic of Croatia contract No. 942-11-11-2003 (2003-2004), and &quot;Quantum Random Bit Generator for applications in cryptography, Monte Carlo simulations and research&quot;, funded by the World Bank, Technology Assistance program TAL-2 (2004-2005). In the most recent of these projects we have investigated new methods for generating truly random numbers and solid state single photon detectors required for various quantum information experiments.

Prof. M. Pavicic has lead projects &quot;Quantum Information Theory&quot;, MoSES contract No 0082222, &quot;Quantum Information and Quantum Communication&quot;, MoSES No 082006, and &quot;Algebraico-Probabilistic Structures of Quantum Mechanics&quot; MoSES No. 1-03-176. Of the results he obtained in these projects we are going to use the theory of two- and four-photon entanglement and the theory and the setup for quantum interrogation as referred in 9.1 and 10.1 above. 

Within the project &quot;Femtosecond laser spectroscopy and ultracold molecules&quot;, MoSES contract No 0035002 (2002-2005), led by prof. dr. sc. G. Pichler, dr. Hrvoje Skenderović has visited the Max-Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching as a Humboldt fellow, during the period 2002.-2004. where he has acquired knowledge and experimental skills about nonlinear laser techniques, pulse shaping and optical parametric amplification. The results on coherent control have just been accepted for publication. Since the entanglement of photons is mostly produced in optical downconversion parametric process and many proposed methods for quantum computing rely on pulse shaping, we find this experience highly relevant for the project.

Working on the project &quot;Analysis of stochastic signals, time series and data structures&quot;, MoSES contract No 0098024 (1996-2001), dr. Branka Medved Rogina performed high resolution timing measurement of optoelectronic devices and systems in high-speed and high-sensitivity sensor and communications applications.</P>

				No scientific novice is initially assigned in this research proposal. However, at the beginning of the project realization we are predicting an immediate need for one scientific novice and a year later for another novice (PhD student).

Both novices would enroll to the PhD program in physics and should finish their dissertation by the end this project period.

Novices would be performing experimental research planned within the project. They would become familiar with the most recent techniques and theoretical results in the field of quantum physics. An advantage would be given to the candidates who have expressed an interest for pursuing their career in experimental quantum physics, who are skillful with computers, who are able to do programming using several computer languages and who preferably (not a requirement) have experience in practical electronics.

It is our general belief that education of novices through their participation on various scientific projects, enriched with the additional theoretical knowledge gained from selected courses offered within the PhD program is the best and the most efficient way to obtain higher education. We anticipate that novices, after completing their PhD on the subject matter proposed in this project, due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research (quantum physics, information theory, statistics, measuring techniques, computer programming and data analysis, practical electronics) and due to the already existing successful scientific production of project group members, could easily find job position in science and/or industry after completion of the project. 

We will hold frequent, regular group meetings with active participation of novices and project investigator in the discussion of results and in planning the ‘next step’. After acquiring the first year experience, novices will be expected to perform experiments with the certain dose of independence, with the respect of their individual differences in professional pursuits from the side of PI. 

Novices will actively participate in interpreting results, writing scientific articles and participating on international scientific meetings. 

They will also be provided through bilateral cooperation grants, FP7 projects and other funds, to visit and study (for limited time) in the international centers of excellence.</P>
